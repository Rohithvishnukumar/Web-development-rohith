the main difference between the selector used in the css and Js is that the selector in css will apply all of the elements which have that id or  class name but in case of js it even though there is a same name for many elements it only gets applied to the first element. to select all we need to use document.querySelectorAll("") which returns a noded list and we need to iterate to get the specific one.



In jQuery, $() or jQuery() replaces document.querySelector()
$() or jQuery() replaces document.querySelectorAll()


But in jQuery it behaves like a normal css selectors

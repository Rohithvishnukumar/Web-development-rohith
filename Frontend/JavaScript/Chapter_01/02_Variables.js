// JS is not a very strict language so you can either use semicolons to end statements or leave it without using it 

console.log("Hello World");

let a = 90;
console.log(a);

a = "Rohith"

console.log(a)


// here you can change the datatype of the variables in runtime as int is changed to string in runtime

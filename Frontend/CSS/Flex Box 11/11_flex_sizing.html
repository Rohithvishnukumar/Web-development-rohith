<!-- width: when there is enough space then it is going to respect the parameter if the space is less then it shrinks to the min-width ( if anything not set it follows highest word length)

flex-basis: same as width but be careful of priority

max-width: it is used to determine how much the element is allowed to grow. (flex-basis gets priority only if the flex-basis is less than max-width) 

min-width: it is used to determine how much the element is allowed to shrink.

flex-grow: allows the element to grow when set to 1 and not when 0

flex-shrink: allows the element to shrink when set to 1 and not when 0-->

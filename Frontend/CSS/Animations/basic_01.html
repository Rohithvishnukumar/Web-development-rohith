<!-- Ease-In: The animation starts slowly and accelerates as it progresses.

Ease-Out: The animation starts quickly and decelerates as it approaches the end.

Ease-In-Out: A combination of ease-in and ease-out, where the animation starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then decelerates towards the end.

Linear: The animation progresses at a constant speed from start to finish without acceleration or deceleration.

Cubic Bezier: A customizable timing function defined by a set of control points, allowing for more fine-grained control over the animation curve. -->
